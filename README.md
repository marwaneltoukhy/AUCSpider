# AUCSpider
Database Final Project

# Project Requirments

This project was a project for the Database course final project.

The project requirement was to develope a database for the AUC catalog, so that students can see all the courses they are registered in, find which courses they can take
and find the history of their courses. Also, students can find out everything about the course (i.e. if there are any prerequisites, description of project, project code, etc..)

The data required for each course was acquired using a web crowler called the AUCSpider that I developed to crawl the AUC online catalog and get all required data from it.

There is then a simple UI developed using python.

The project is divided into 3 milestones, you will find them called MS1, MS2 and MS3.
